## How?
The algorithm's goal is to maximize the player score and minimize the opponent's score.\
When I first started this project, I did not know the minimax algorithm, but I was able to conceptualize it before encountering it in CS50AI. I thought of it as exploring all *possible worlds,* (i.e. every possible move's results). Thus, the AI already knows what the outcome of each and every move and it's subsequent moves before it even makes a move.
### Here's a visual to better understand it

I highly recommend watching the [CS50 2020 - Artificial Intelligence (pre-release)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUKDDbL24lI&t=1460s) segment on minimax.
