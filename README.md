## How?
The algorithm's goal is to maximize the player score and minimize the opponent's score.\
To easily conceptualize it, I try thinking of it as exploring all *possible worlds,* (i.e. every possible move's results) before making a move. Thus, the AI already knows what the outcome of each and every move is and it's subsequent moves and so on before it even makes a move.
### Here's a visual to better understand it

I highly recommend watching the [CS50 2020 - Artificial Intelligence (pre-release)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUKDDbL24lI&t=1460s) segment on minimax.
